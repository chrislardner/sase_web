Their dedication to uplifting young professionals like ourselves while recognizing early talent from the Asian diaspora is invaluable. Face-to-face conversations with company representatives have always been a staple of SASE RHIT, and we are beyond grateful to have benefited from years of advice! We hope to continue to make strong partnerships in the future that connect enterprising companies with dedicated, curious students like ourselves.",

In our last event, we were able to provide 540 school meals in an hour with the help of all of our members. With this event, we are able to blend cultural exchange with philanthropy as we make a real difference for countless children worldwide.",
