Bikes for Tykes is an annual service event that allows students to apply their building skills to give back to the community! This event partners Rose students with Chances and Services for Youth (CASY) and Bikes for TykesⓇ to provide bicycles for children/teens in need at little-to-no cost for Christmas. SASE volunteers as a group for this event annually, working in teams to assemble both adult and child-sized bikes for the Vigo County community. This event brings all of campus together to build bikes while connecting us to both each other and the local community at large, reminding us of the little things we can do to bring joy to and help others!" },
    { id: "company-talks", title: "Company Talks", description: "Obtaining personal interactions with company representatives is critical to helping students  both understand what their future career may look like as well as what different career journeys look like. Whether it’s about the best way to interview, organize a resume, or insider tips about industry, we greatly appreciate the opportunity to have worked with so many amazing companies in the past. Their dedication to uplifting young professionals like ourselves while recognizing early talent from the Asian diaspora is invaluable. Face-to-face conversations with company representatives have always been a staple of SASE RHIT, and we are beyond grateful to have benefited from years of advice! We hope to continue to make strong partnerships in the future that connect enterprising companies with dedicated, curious students like ourselves." },

    { id: "boba-night", title: "Boba Night", description: "On our campus, boba is scarce. The nearest boba shop is hours away. We solve the problem. With our quarterly “Boba Night,” we bring homemade boba tea free of charge to every attendee, bridging cultural and economic barriers. Hosting over 10% of the on-campus student body and having tripled in attendance since its conception in 2022, Boba Night is our fastest-growing event. We want to continue to make boba an accessible, delicious experience for all." },
    { id: "onigiri-action", title: "Onigiri Action", description: "Each fall, we join the global “Onigiri Action” campaign where we turn Japanese rice balls called onigiri into a powerful act of giving. In this event, all students are invited to craft onigiri and take photos with them. We then post these photos on social media with the tag “#OnigiriAction,” which triggers a donation of five school meals to children in need for every photo shared. In our last event, we were able to provide 540 school meals in an hour with the help of all of our members. With this event, we are able to blend cultural exchange with philanthropy as we make a real difference for countless children worldwide." },

    { id: "spring-carnival", title: "Spring Carnival", description: "Indiana sits in the center of the euchre belt.

Providing a nostalgic experience for those far from home while offering new experiences to others, we prepare foods like sticky rice, appam, and scallion pancakes for all. At Spring Carnival, we aim to foster a strong sense of community, sharing the traditions that shaped us." },

These adventures off campus allow us to explore new experiences and develop better work-life balance." },

This event brings together hundreds of students to support the Terre Haute community through hands-on service projects. Working on a new project each year, we always love the opportunity to both make a meaningful impact on our community while bonding with our chapter.
